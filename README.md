# optimal_multi-supply_mar
This is a repository for model scripts that describe and optimize designs for producing and delivering full advanced treated recycled water to existing stormwater spreading basins. runGeneralScenarios_paper2.m is the main script.

As a case study, the code uses the Hansen Spreading Grounds and three water recycling facilities in Los Angeles, CA.

The code is available here for your reference; unfortunately, I cannot provide support for its use.

This code was developed using MATLAB R2016b and relies on the Optimization Toolbox and Parallel Computing Toolbox.
